Key Takeaways for Access Modifiers:
When to Use Each:
🔓 PUBLIC (Default)

APIs and interfaces that external code needs
Properties that should be accessible everywhere
Methods that form the public contract of your class

🔒 PRIVATE

Internal implementation details
Helper methods and sensitive data
Anything that should be hidden from external access
Use this by default, then make public only when needed

🔐 PROTECTED

When you have inheritance hierarchies
Properties/methods that subclasses need but external code shouldn't access
Template method patterns
Shared functionality in class families

📖 READONLY

Configuration values and constants
IDs, timestamps, and immutable properties
Values set once during initialization
Prevents accidental modification

⚡ STATIC

Utility functions that don't need instance data
Class-level constants and counters
Factory methods and singleton patterns
Shared functionality across all instances

Best Practices:

Principle of Least Privilege: Start with private, only make public when necessary
Immutability: Use readonly for values that shouldn't change
Inheritance: Use protected when subclasses need access
Class-level: Use static for functionality that belongs to the class, not instances
Combine wisely: private static readonly for class constants

This hierarchy helps maintain encapsulation, which is crucial for building maintainable and secure applications in LLD scenarios.
